## What did we make?
- TANK - Total Annihilation Not Komplete
- It will give users of the Android app the possibility of detecting objects by looking at a camera feed. This camera feed is recieved from the bot they control in SMCE
- This program will let users control a smart bot in SMCE with the objective of crashing into other SMCE bots.
- It will possibly be able to do automated bot hunting.  

## Why did we make? What problem was solved?
- Tank will solve the issue of how to detect objects, and will assist App users in hunting down these objects and crash into them (mainly other bots/smartcars)
- It can be used to cause mayhem and destruction (i.e. the dark side) and learn the findings and experience to avoid the same in real world (i.e. the noble side)

## How did we make? What kind of technology we used?
We will use OpenCV in combination with an Android app, in order to detect objects in the SMCE world. Technologies we will use:
- C++
- Python
- OpenCV
- Android/Java
- SMCE
- GitHub
