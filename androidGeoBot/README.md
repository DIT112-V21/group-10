# Tank Android Application

## IDE
* We are using Android Studio with a Pixel 3(API 29-30) emulator, while developing.

## Libraries that this application depends on:
* https://opencv.org/releases/

## Setup Instructions:
* Download OpenCV version 3.4.14 from here: https://opencv.org/releases/, or simply get the needed files from here: https://github.com/DIT112-V21/group-10/tree/object-detection/tools-libraries-etc
* Add the libs folder( C:\*\OpenCV-android-sdk-3.4.14\sdk\native\libs ) to "\app\src\main\jniLibs"
* You should now be able to build and run the application! if not, send the Logcat file from Android Studio() to your prefered support person.
