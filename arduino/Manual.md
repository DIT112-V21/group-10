# Car Manual

This car is able to do basic tasks such as moving forward and backward and turning.
It avoids different obstacles standing in the distance of 200cm of its front side by
moving backward for a short while with the same speed it had while going forward as
soon as the obstacle is detected and turning 50 degrees to the left and again going forward.

How to control the car:

- To go forward or backward with a desired speed, you should insert "m" and then your desired speed
  into the serial and then press Enter. If the speed input is negative the car will go backward,
  otherwise it moves forward.
- To change the direction of the car to a desired angle you should insert "t" and then your desired angle
  into the serial and then press Enter. If the degree input is negative the car will turn clockwise,
  otherwise it turns counter clockwise.
