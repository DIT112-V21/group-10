## What did we make?
- TANK - Total Annihilation Not Komplete
- It will give users of the Android app the possibility of detecting objects by looking at a camera feed. This camera feed is recieved from the bot they control in SMCE
- This program will let users control a smart bot in SMCE with the objective of crashing into other SMCE bots.
- It will possibly be able to do automated bot hunting.  

## Why did we make? What problem was solved?
- Tank will solve the issue of how to detect objects, and will assist App users in hunting down these objects and crash into them (mainly other bots/smartcars)
- It can be used to cause mayhem and destruction (i.e. the dark side) and learn the findings and experience to avoid the same in real world (i.e. the noble side)
- It can be used as a tool for anger management and control.
