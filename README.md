## Demo Video (must watch)

TODO: add video link

## What did we make?
- TANK - Total Annihilation Not Komplete
- We made an Android app with the possibility of detecting cars by looking at a camera feed
- This camera feed is received from the bot they control in SMCE
- This program will let users control a smart bot in SMCE with the objective of crashing into other SMCE bots, gaining points for every object crashed into

## Why did we make this? What problem was solved?
- Tank will assist users in hunting down objects and crashing into them.
- It can be used to cause mayhem and destruction (i.e. the dark side) and learn the findings and experience to avoid the same in real world (i.e. the noble side)
- We made this as a tool for anger management and control.
