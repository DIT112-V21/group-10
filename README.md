# Group 10

## What you are going to make?
- GeoBot 	
- This program will let users control a smart vehicle and possibly turn on automated exploring.  
- It will be able to create and map an unidentified area.

## Why will you make it? What problem does it solve?
- GeoBot will automatically explore and create a map of an unknown area 
- It can be used to explore places that are potentially dangerous for humans

## How you are going to make it? What kind of technology you are going to use?

We will use Unity engine and OpenCV in order to create a map of the SMCE world using tiles of different colours. The tiles will be added as the car moves along exploring the area. We will also use:
- C++
- Android/Java
- SMCE
- GitHub
- Arduino/C
